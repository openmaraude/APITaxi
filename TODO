Checks before release:

- ADS is identified by a numero and an insee code. The same ADS can be
  registered with several operators.

  We have duplicates: same insee_code/numero for different operators.

  When we retrieve an ADS (in POST /taxis, maybe also somewhere else), we
  should maybe also filter on ADS.added_by.
