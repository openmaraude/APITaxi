Checks before release:

- ADS is identified by a numero and an insee code. The same ADS can be
  registered with several operators.

  We have duplicates: same insee_code/numero for different operators.

  When we retrieve an ADS (in POST /taxis, maybe also somewhere else), we
  should maybe also filter on ADS.added_by.

  Plan:

    - Get all hails where operateur_id != taxi.ADS.added_by:
        SELECT hail.operateur_id, hail.taxi_id, "ADS".added_by FROM hail JOIN taxi ON taxi.id = hail.taxi_id JOIN "ADS" ON "ADS".id = taxi.ads_id WHERE hail.operateur_id != "ADS".added_by

    - For each hail, duplicate the ADS with the correct operateur id
    - Fix POST /ads and create an unique key on (numero, insee, added_by)
    - Fix POST /taxis to use the correct ADS
